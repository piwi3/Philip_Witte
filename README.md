__Welcome!__ This page gives an __overview of my most recent and relevant projects__. Since I am in the middle of a data science bootcamp, this is still highly __work in progress__. I will further clean up the code and add more projects over the upcoming weeks/months.

## [1: Gifs of CO2 vs. income over time based on gapminder data](https://github.com/piwi3/gap_minder_gif)
- Collected data from [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) project
- Used pandas to structure and manipulate data
- Created gif using seaborn

## [2: Classification of survival on the titanic](https://github.com/piwi3/classification_with_titanic_data)
- Titanic data set from Kaggle is used for this project
- Several ML classifiers are built with sckit-learn (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, grouped/ensemble classifier)
- Project comprises all phases of ML work flow: 
    + data exploration
    + feature engineering
    + creation of classifier 
    + optimization of hyperparameters
    + evaluation using different KPIS (cross-validation)
- All created classifiers are compared and the best one is further tuned by optimizing thresholds for classification
