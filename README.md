__Welcome!__ This page gives an __overview of my most recent and relevant projects__. Since I am in the middle of a data science bootcamp, this is still highly __work in progress__. I will further clean up the code and add more projects over the upcoming weeks/months.

## [1: Gifs of CO2 vs. income over time based on gapminder data](https://github.com/piwi3/gap_minder_gif)
- Collected data from [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) project
- Used pandas to structure and manipulate data
- Created gif using seaborn

## [2: Classification of survival on the titanic](https://github.com/piwi3/classification_with_titanic_data)
- Titanic data set from Kaggle is used for this project
- Built several ML classifiers with sckit-learn (logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, random forest, voting classifier)
- Project comprises all phases of ML work flow (e.g., data exploration, feature engineering (incl. pipelines), optimization of hyperparameters, evaluation via cross-validation) and the best classifier is further tuned by optimizing predictions thresholds.
